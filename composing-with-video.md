#Composing with Video    
##Introduction
<!-- This section should be an overview of what the modality of video is and why the multimodal composer should be concerned with them. --> Video can be an effective tool to engage your audience and tell a compelling story about a particular subject. Visual materials are important to western societies and video can help us understand various cultures in a captivating way that can be persuasive. The theory of semiotics helps us to understand how video can be so persuasive, it allows the audience to interpret the images, text, and sound to create meaning and feel a particular way. The following examples will demonstrate how video is working together with images, text, and audio to create meaningful connections and help us make sense of the world.

Video Rhetoric: EWG Program’s “Setting The Bar Low”
  
https://vimeo.com/185514494

For my video analysis, I chose “Setting the Bar Low” by Wander on behalf of the Environmental Working Group (EWG). The Environmental Working Group is an organization that researches and “calls out” companies who use questionable chemical compounds in their products. They also have website ranking certain beauty/body care products based on ingredients and potential toxicity. 
  

How silly would it be if we admired athletes and artists for doing the bare minimum? In EWG/Wander’s opinion, that is what we are doing with manufacturers. By making “heroic” feats we know so well look ridiculous, they are asking us in a way...why don’t we hold companies to the same standards as we hold our cultural heroes? Using the Olympics, mountain climbing, and conductor/orchestra as recognizable exciting/important moments, they are able to communicate the level that they believe manufacturers should be held to. They should be the heroes of product safety! EWG’s stance is that the products we are receiving are the equivalent of a 7.5 inch high jump. By engaging these familiar cultural messages, the EWG is able to communicate how dire the issue is to a broad audience.
  

Video is an effective mode for this message because it triggers memories of the things we watched...old educational videos, sporting events, music, etc. They are also able to use a mix of different modes within the video...visual, aural, and text...to communicate their message. I think that’s why videos can have so much emotional impact, they have the ability to overtake multiple senses at once and leave a lasting impression.
  

My video: When the tablet’s away, the kids will play.

My son is pretty much the only person in my life that will let me film him willingly. Like many kids, he is pretty tablet/tv/game obsessed. It's been a constant struggle to kind of monitor and limit his use of devices without demonizing them. Honestly, sometimes I’m grateful he’s distracted by them when he’s forced to follow me around to work/study group, but I love watching him play. I guess that’s what I wanted to communicate in my 5 shots: how kids kind of bloom in their play, and they don’t really do that in front of a screen. They are so expressive, energetic, and creative when they actually have to use their brains.

Many companies and businesses will use videos as an effective marketing tool to capture their audiences attention and persuade them to buy a product, use their service, or join their team. The following video from Google is about five student summer interns and their thoughts on what it is like to work at Google. The video is interesting and engaging for a college student considering an internship at Google. College students can relate to the interns interviewed because diversity is reflected and their personal interests are also reflected. 

The Google video opens with employees showing how fun it is to work at Google and how it is like a playground. Employees are biking around campus, playing volleyball, table tennis, and eating outdoors on the lawn. Their main speakers says “don’t be afraid to fail, but we want to flip that around a bit and say don’t be afraid to succeed” and the camera zooms in on each of the five interns faces. The story then goes into following each of the interns showing what their job entails and why they enjoy working at Google. They incorporate the 5-point shots to focus on each intern’s personal story and to really help the audience get to know each of the interns on a more personal basis. The b-roll is also a technique in which images and clips of other interesting objects or subjects in they're surrounding environment are incorporated into the interviews. What makes this video so effective is the collection of images, sounds, and text helping to build the affect that it is intending to create for their audience. By the end of the video, Google has been able to establish a relationship and build empathy between the college interns they interviewed and one that interested college students can easily related to in order to persuade them to work at their company.

To demonstrate just how effective the 5-point shot sequence can be, I created a video of my coworker Julia working at her desk that demonstrates these techniques. Julia is a membership coordinator and her job primarily is supporting nonprofit members and answering their emails. The video of Julia shows the following sequence; a close-up of her hands typing on her laptop, close-up of her face looking at the computer monitor, a side-angle shot of both Julia and the computer monitor, a wide-angle shot over her shoulders, and finally a wide-angle shot that includes a view of her entire workspace. I included audio of her typing but no other audio or sounds because I wanted to focus on Julia as my subject of the video. Collecting all of the various camera angles produces a story that helps to better understand what Julia does for work.

##Best Practices
Some best practices for creating a video:
1) Define your audience before creating the video
2) Define: What is your message or story? Write it out into a sequence.
3) Keep it short and simple by editing what is not necessary to your story.
4) Use a voice over if you can't get good audio from filming.
5) Use the b-roll technique to incorporate alternative footage or images to make the story interesting. 
6) Incorporate the 5-point shot sequence: close-up of the hands, close-up of the face, wide angle shot of the character doing some action, a point of view shot over the character's shoulder, and an unusual or alternative perspective shot. 
7) Edit and incorporate text or audio if necessary

##Conclusion

Videos are engaging and ignite emotions with their audience. It is a powerful modality and one that is becoming widely popular on social media platforms. As demonstrated in the examples, videos can help build trust with a particular company or persuade us to think a particular way about a subject. Videos can have a strong emotional impact because they touch on multiple senses and can have a lasting impact.
