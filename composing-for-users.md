#Composing for Users
##Introduction
<!-- This section should discuss how multimodal composition needs to change in a digital setting where the audience isn't viewers, but users. -->
##Emily:

 When composing for users, it’s important to keep in mind how the user will interact with the piece you are creating. The interaction adds to your piece, rather than feeling tedious and unnecessary. For my project, “What the pictures don’t tell you”, I tried to make it so the user could move through my story at their own pace. I also added a couple of audio elements: they can listen to me talk about the background of my project, or they can listen to music while they browse my story. I also added images for visual impact and interest. See my project here: https://mm-final.bubbleapps.io
