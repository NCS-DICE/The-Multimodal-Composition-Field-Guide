Audio Rhetoric: The Walk



{insert audio file}



When I’m frustrated or anxious …I walk. When my son is cranky or is feeling wiggly…we walk. It’s a cure for whatever ails me, or it at least distracts me from what I don’t want to do. It gives me purpose, moving forward…burning calories…whatever thought keeps me going a I work through my troubles on the sidewalk.

I throw on my favorite coat, my dirty purple puffy coat that swooshes loudly while I walk. I leave the house and slam the door. Today I’m annoyed, overwhelmed. I don’t even take the dog with me this time…I’m tired of her barking and her demands. I’m tired of my son’s talking and demands. I need to be alone. I walk quickly across the parking lot and shove my headphones in. I hope I don’t run into a neighbor…I live in a friendly neighborhood, and everyone wants to stop and chat about the weather, and the grass, and the stray cat situation. My music is supposed to be soothing but it hardly works, I swoosh angrily down the sidewalk and the cold wind hurts my ears. I think about the things my boyfriend didn’t say right and about how the cat woke me up at 2am with her yowling.

My sulking temporarily comes to a halt as a neighbor walks toward me. The one with the 3 little dogs. Annoying dogs, barking dogs. Oh, except the brown one. Actually, the 2 black ones are cute too. Ok, maybe they are not very annoying. Just like with my dog, I’m won over by their small noses and big brown eyes. Their owner approaches and makes a comment, and I have to do that “polite” laugh. But then the brown dog jumps on my leg gently, and the two others approach my hand as I reach down instinctually. I laugh genuinely now. She tells me to “have a good night”. I’m still giggling. My dog also reaches out for anyone who gives her half a glance on the sidewalk. She’s not so bad.

Same with the cat. She does the yowling, but she’s 18 years old. Being old has made her very needy, and a formerly aloof kitty had become quite the cuddler in her senior years. She’s pretty sweet.

My kid is also sweet. Sometimes, he just talks so much…and argues, and barters. It’s kind of amazing the level of skill he uses to go back and forth with me. We are a long way from throwing tantrums over getting the wrong teddy bear. His brain moves constantly, and he’s so creative. And I’m fortunate enough to be the one he tells everything too…whether it’s a story about a hero named Toilet Boy, or about conflict at school. I’m glad he’s not too quiet, I guess.

And I’m not sure how I can get on my boyfriend’s case about saying the wrong thing. I constantly say the wrong thing. And maybe I needed to hear what he said. I should probably text him. Oh wow, my fingers are frozen.

It’s cold out, but at least it’s not raining. The air is fresh. My legs work. My coat is warm. I like this song. But it’s time to go inside. What was I mad about, anyway?
