Sound can be very persuasive and create excitement for the audience. When I think of the movie franchise Star Wars I immediately think of the introductory opening crawl sound that has been branded with the name. The opening classical instrumental theme song for Star Wars has become the anthem of the saga at the opening and ending of the film series. The theme has become iconic in American culture and its symbolic meaning is often associated with the future and adventure of technology and space. The theme song starts off with a loud bang of trumpets, taking you on an adventure of sounds, midway it drops to a low classical tempo to once again lead up the excitement with drums and the loud sound of trumpets. The change in sound, instruments, and tempo lead to the triumphal victory of sounds.

Sound has been very important in films and used to create the overall movie experience for the audience. “Michel Chion, a researcher of film sound, has referred to two types of added value of sound in film: informative and expressive” \(Hermann, Hunt, Neuhoff, 2011\). In Star Wars, the opening crawl is both informative and expressive, preparing the audience for a long adventure ahead that leads to triumph. The beginning of the song immediately grabs my attention and I'm drawn in by the sounds of the trumpets. The middle of song drops off with a soft classical melody later leads to the anticipation of loud pounding drums reflective of the sounds at the start of a war battle or marching band. The affect this produces gives the audience some perspective on what to anticipate in the film and relies on the audiences previous knowledge that their will be a battle and struggle that eventually leads to a victory. The theme song has been used in all of the Star Wars films, commercials, toy products, games and more, to design a recognizable auditory logo for the franchise. This recognizable auditory logo makes it easy for the audience to establish an association with the Star Wars brand and familiarity with the genre of the film’s storyline.
