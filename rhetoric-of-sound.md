**Using Music To Give People The Creeps: Atlanta Monster's Aural Rhetoric**

Most of us can think of a sound that makes us feel afraid. A twig snapping in the quiet, eerie music, footsteps when there shouldn’t be footsteps…sound is an excellent way to creep someone out. Which is probably why when I try to think of a genre that leans on sound to make an audience feel afraid, I think of the crime thriller…or more specifically for me, “true crime”. I’ve been a fan of the “true crime” genre since I was a teenager. My mom and I would often hunker down to watch 48 hours, Forensic Files, or Unsolved Mysteries despite the fact we often went to bed later scared out of our minds. Even just hearing the theme music gives me the shivers. Honestly, I remember them more than any photo from those shows. Now, I don’t watch too much TV, but true crime podcast has become my new guilty pleasure. My new favorite is Atlanta Monster, about the convicted murderer Wayne Williams and the Atlanta child murders in the early 1980s. The audio elements of this podcast can make my stomach sink in a heartbeat, and the excellent storytelling keeps me coming back for the next chapter.

The sound of a voice can be comforting, and in Atlanta Monster the is a narrator never seems audibly unnerved by what he discovers. However, the way they mix his narration with interviews keeps it interesting. Formal in-studio interviews with police are mixed in with muffled/staticky phone calls from jail from Wayne Williams and informal in-home interviews with community members. The audio constantly twists and turns, and sometimes there is no formal transition between one person and the next. There are also other audio elements in the story give keep listeners on their toes. At the beginning/end/transitions, a specific haunting melody plays. The fast pace synthesizer music is unsettling, and you can nearly feel your heart beat more quickly to match- you know that when the music plays, there is going to be a twist in the story or horrible facts revealed. The music and the mixing of tones and audio quality leave the listener on their toes…you are never sure what to expect. I often feel as anxious as I would while watching a thriller, even though I’m usually doing something as mundane as dishes or walking the dog. 



This constant ups and downs with the audio material conveys what the writers want you to know about Wayne Williams story…there are a million twists and turns. The journalists are discovering much of their facts while making the podcasts. They don’t know what to expect, and sound is used as the mode to give the listener the same feeling of tension.
