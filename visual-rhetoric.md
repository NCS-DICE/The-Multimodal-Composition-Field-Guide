Multimodal composition has been an important part of childhood education forever. It’s important for children to learn have different tactile, visual, audio, and other sensory experiences to pair with reading, writing, and math. Now more than ever, teachers and parents use more digital content for education. These digital tools are also multimodal, and like non-digital learning materials they have to appeal to certain age and development groups. When creating digital content, it can be hard to find that right balance of kid friendly, informative, and easy to use.

Creating content for children, especially the “big kids”, kids between 6-10 who are not little but are also not tweens, can be especially difficult. Children in that age want to build independence and want to be treated as if they are mature and intelligent. At the same time, children in that age groups can have huge variances in their skills…for example, at 6 it is very normal for children not to read fluently. At the same time, it’s not very out of the ordinary for a 6 year old to be reading small chapter books without much help. Your educational content must be varied and accessible, but a child is only really going to care about that if they are attracted to your site in the first place.

Brainpop is a favorite of my son’s so I chose to analyze it to understand why it appeals to him more now than some of the other learning apps/websites he used to love. The first thing I noticed about the website is the colors. Though it is colorful, Brainpop focuses on earth tones rather than the bright primary or neon colors featured in sites for preschoolers. The graphics are in a very simplified but very bold 2D representations of people and other objects. While they do use humor to and sometimes a friendly robot to help with concepts, there are no colorful puppets or animals to explain subjects. When they use the robot, it’s usually the “person” teaching rather than the other way around. The site features teaching tools for math, science, reading, coding, and health and each subject uses accurate but age appropriate visuals. They are able to make some things like the digestive system less visually shocking to look at for a child while explaining it simply and factually.

Most of the visual content is delivered in video format, which is probably most attractive to kids coming to the website. It also makes it easily accessible…difficult concepts like computer programming or the Civil Rights Movement could be confusing and cumbersome for kids who can’t read fluently. A video allows them to get an overview of the information in a visually stimulating format. The video also contains an audio component that can help children with certain visual impairments, and closed captions for children with hearing impairments. Additionally, for any child who can’t or does not want to watch a video, there are also transcripts available.

It’s also important to use visual to break down educational content into easy-to-swallow pieces, to make it easier to listen to and remember. When each subject is paired with something visual, it seems more interested and attractive to kids \(especially modern kids who are pretty used to large amount of visual stimulation on a daily basis, you really have to catch their eye\). For instance, a course on Digital Citizenship probably seems uninteresting to the average 7 year old at first, but break it down like this and:

 Digital Citizenship looks accessible and interesting. Kids can take it at their own pace and learn about what is most relevent to them
