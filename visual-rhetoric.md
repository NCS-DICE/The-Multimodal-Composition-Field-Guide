# Visual Rhetoric-Analysis: Sun Mad Raisins \(1982\) Poster

Can a poster truly inspire a social and political movement? In the early 1960’s, the Chicano political art movement brought to light many important social justice issues including the oppressive mistreatment of farmworkers. The controversial Sun-Mad Raisins \(1982\) poster of a female skeleton holding a basket full of grapes resembled and plays off of the Sun-Maid \(1912\) iconic poster and popular raisin brand. They still remain a large agricultural producer from the Central Valley of California \([Sun-Maid Raisins](http://www.sunmaid.com/about-sun-maid.html), 2018\). It may be interpreted as a rhetorical response against the California agricultural industry. The San Francisco artist Ester Hernandez, intended for the Sun-Mad poster to “create a dialogue about the new face of farm workers, indigenous peoples from Mexico and Central America” \([Ester Hernandez](https://apps.ams.usda.gov/pdp), 2012\). Although the Sun-Mad image was used in the plight of farmworkers and the social justice Chicano movement it initially did not receive much attention \([Art in Print,](http://artinprint.org/article/ester-hernandez-sun-mad/%23footnote_4_2168) 2018\). The poster was revealed in part to a political protest during the United Farmworkers movement and struggle for fair wages and labor rights. The message of the poster later educated and raised awareness to the issues facing farmworkers. It is an example of Chicano political art of an effective visual rhetorical image which became an iconic poster in the plight of farmworkers and used to expose the injustice and treatment of farmworkers.

The artist was inspired to use the Sun-Maid logo because it was a culturally iconic image easily identifiable as a healthy fruit snack amongst consumers. The Sun-Maid brand is quickly identified with lots of red and the image of a happy healthy young women wearing a white bonnet holding a basket full of grapes. The general audience are consumers who enjoy eating a healthy snack. I often associate Sun-Maid raisins as the ideal choice for wholesome families who enjoy eating oatmeal cookies, chocolate covered raisins, and cinnamon swirl raisin bread. The brand remains the same to this date and continues to be quickly identified amongst American consumers.![](/assets/Sun Maid.jpg)

Ester Hernandez chose a poster as the medium for making a strong visual political statement for its audience. One can consider the intertextuality of Sun-Mad Raisins \(1982\) poster to be in reference to Sun-Maid’s iconic logo. She wanted to use imagery to capture people's attention and show the unfair treatment of agricultural farmworkers. Farmworkers were often mistreated in the fields and the grape industry was one of the largest agricultural industries in California that sprayed dangerous and toxic chemicals on farmworkers. The company had been known for using dangerous and harsh chemicals \([USDA](https://apps.ams.usda.gov/pdp), 2018\). As a result, farmworkers were exposed to these toxic chemicals and had high rates of cancer, asthma, or children born with physical and mental disabilities. In contrast to the iconic Sun-Maid logo, Ester Hernandez decided to use a female skeleton, a more grim image than the young vibrant woman depicted on the packages of it’s products. A skeleton or calavera is a symbol associated with death and culturally relevant to those who celebrate Day of the Dead. The image of the skeleton helps to bring awareness to the death and treatment of agricultural farmworkers exposed to harsh chemicals. The image also changes the original text of "Natural California Raisins" to include wording with the following text, “Unnaturally Grown with insecticides, miticides, herbicides, and fungicides”. Thus, when the audience is interpreting and making meaning of the poster they see it as a direct statement to what seemed "natural” is actually the direct result of the harmful toxic pesticides used by Sun Maid raisins.
