**Multimodal Education: How Visual Media And Color Sets BrainPop Apart From Other Educational Sites**



Multimodal composition has been an important part of childhood education forever. It’s important for children to learn have different tactile, visual, audio, and other sensory experiences to pair with reading, writing, and math. Now more than ever, teachers and parents use more digital content for education. These digital tools are also multimodal, and like non-digital learning materials they have to appeal to certain age and development groups. When creating digital content, it can be hard to find that right balance of kid friendly, informative, and easy to use.

Creating content for children, especially the “big kids”, kids between 6-10 who are not little but are also not tweens, can be especially difficult. Children in that age want to build independence and want to be treated as if they are mature and intelligent. At the same time, children in that age groups can have huge variances in their skills…for example, at 6 it is very normal for children not to read fluently. At the same time, it’s not very out of the ordinary for a 6 year old to be reading small chapter books without much help. Your educational content must be varied and accessible, but a child is only really going to care about that if they are attracted to your site in the first place.

Brainpop is a favorite of my son’s so I chose to analyze it to understand why it appeals to him more now than some of the other learning apps/websites he used to love. The first thing I noticed about the website is the colors. Though it is colorful, Brainpop focuses on earth tones rather than the bright primary or neon colors featured in sites for preschoolers. The graphics are in a very simplified but very bold 2D representations of people and other objects. While they do use humor to and sometimes a friendly robot to help with concepts, there are no colorful puppets or animals to explain subjects. When they use the robot, it’s usually the “person” teaching rather than the other way around. The site features teaching tools for math, science, reading, coding, and health and each subject uses accurate but age appropriate visuals. They are able to make some things like the digestive system less visually shocking to look at for a child while explaining it simply and factually.

Most of the visual content is delivered in video format, which is probably most attractive to kids coming to the website. It also makes it easily accessible…difficult concepts like computer programming or the Civil Rights Movement could be confusing and cumbersome for kids who can’t read fluently. A video allows them to get an overview of the information in a visually stimulating format. The video also contains an audio component that can help children with certain visual impairments, and closed captions for children with hearing impairments. Additionally, for any child who can’t or does not want to watch a video, there are also transcripts available.

It’s also important to use visual to break down educational content into easy-to-swallow pieces, to make it easier to listen to and remember. When each subject is paired with something visual, it seems more interested and attractive to kids \(especially modern kids who are pretty used to large amount of visual stimulation on a daily basis, you really have to catch their eye\). For instance, a course on Digital Citizenship probably seems uninteresting to the average 7 year old at first, but break it down like this and:

Digital Citizenship looks accessible and interesting. Kids can take it at their own pace and learn about what is most relevant to them.

What I really thought about during this analysis is that there are ways to subtly communicate things to kids about what is “right” for their age group with things like color and art. It’s something I never thought about before about children’s materials. They are really “marketed” certain things visually \(bright colors! Cutesy animals! Goofy voices!\) from the time they are little, but there comes an age where they want to reject that “littleness”. By changing up a few of these visual cues Brainpop is able to communicate that this website is for “big kids” without ever coming out and saying it.

# Multimodal composition: [My Grandmother's Lingo](https://www.sbs.com.au/mygrandmotherslingo/)

Can you recall a story your Grandmother told you as a child? Do you remember the sound of her voice? Perhaps you remember her warm embrace or the smell of her rose scent perfume as she sat you on her lap to retell her childhood stories. Maybe she made used a picture, an object, or a book to help retell the story. Thinking back to our Grandparents brings back memories and as much as we wish they lived forever, their stories continue to resonate with us and have a lasting impact on our lives. One woman who is helping to preserve her Grandmother’s stories and native language is Angelina Joshua. She created an online interactive experience titled [My Grandmother’s Lingo](https://www.sbs.com.au/mygrandmotherslingo/) because she wanted to help preserve the endangered language of the indigenous Aboriginals of Australia.

> “[Currently, there are only three people left in Angelina’s community, Ngukurr, who can speak Marra fluently. Angelina works tirelessly at the local language center to record and learn as much as she can, hoping to pass on her knowledge to future generations](https://www.sbs.com.au/learn/mygrandmotherslingo-explainer).” \(Wenitong, 2016\).

The multimodal website brings together the unique combination of voice-activated technology, animation, and text to create an online immersive platform that both engages the audience with a captivating story while teaching them Marra, her Grandmother’s native language. The best multimodal stories use a range of media and modes to communicate a meaningful story to build empathy with the audience. Rhetoric is the art of persuasion and I will demonstrate how [My Grandmother’s Lingo](https://www.sbs.com.au/mygrandmotherslingo/) effectively demonstrates user-centered designed thinking to build empathy with the audience by using multiple modalities to communicate.

The story of My Grandmother’s Lingo begins with a journey into the life of Angelina Joshua and the history of her Grandmother’s language of Marra. The main page of the website is a simple black and white design of the night sky with a combination of text and images of nature that notifies the audience, “This story NEEDS your VOICE”. Just below the text, it says, “Over the next 10 minutes, you’ll speak one of the older languages in the world” and each word you learn will reveal a new chapter in Angelina’s personal story behind the importance of preserving the Marra language. As you begin your journey into the animated story, you are asked to participate by repeating the words you hear and see on the screen. Having no prior experience about the history or culture of the Aboriginal people, I immediately thought this was a fun way to learn their language and hear their personal stories.

Just before the audience begins the interactive digital story, statistics are used to explain the reason for preserving the language. The compelling statistic states that “More than 90% of Australia’s indigenous languages are critically endangered.” This statistic helps to persuade the audience that learning this language is critical and important. The urgency of this context compels the reader to continue and press the START button to learn more. ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-26 at 12.40.09 PM.png)Intrigued to learn what happens next, I click the START button and immediately I’m introduced to a beautiful flapping red butterfly moving across the screen. I’m given instructions on how to proceed and introduced to the first word of my ten-minute language lesson. The first word written on the screen is “Marra” and a woman’s voice pronounces the word for me to repeat back. I repeat the word aloud to my computer microphone and wait for the next step. Finally, the story begins and I’m flying high above across the blue riverbank and rocks alongside the red flapping butterfly. The animated images give the illusion that the screen appears to be moving in an upward direction. I move forward and hear the voice of a woman narrating the story and showing me the village of where she is from. Relying on audio cues and the story I create an image in my imagination of a woman named Angelina sharing her story. As the audience moves forward with the story you begin to hear soft flowing instrumental music along with simple outlined animated images of birds, animals, and nature.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-26 at 12.53.31 PM.png) ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-01-26 at 1.12.02 PM.png)

For a moment I stop to read the instructions on the screen that remind me of my presence in the story. The words of encouragement say, “Unlock FIVE WORDS and help keep the language alive. Ready?”. Excited to learn the next word, I follow the instructions and continue my mission to learn Marra. A crow flies in front of my screen and leads me to the next chapter. I begin to hear sounds of crickets chirping in the background and see images of homes and symbolic representations of people. Angeline quietly whispers, “my language…it’s dying, you know” as if it were a secret that I needed to help her share. The story continues to move along and I learn more about the Marra language and Aboriginal culture.

The interactivity with visual images to tell the story help to create motion and movement. The combination of animation, sounds, human voice, and interaction design makes the story’s content expressive and it comes alive on the screen. At the end of my journey with Angeline, she shows me that I’ve become a part of the story and helping to preserve her Grandmother’s language. The map of the world at the end shows how I played my part in saving the endangered indigenous language. [Grandmother’s Lingo ](https://www.sbs.com.au/mygrandmotherslingo/)interactive design helped me cross cultural boundaries and build empathy with Angelina’s story and equipped with a better understanding of her Aboriginal language and culture.
