**The Visual Rhetoric of**_** My Favorite Thing Is Monsters**_

“My Favorite Thing Is Monsters” by Emil Ferris is a trip through Chicago’s Uptown neighborhood in the late 1960’s through the eyes and ears of a young teenage girl. Though it started off as being an entertainment district with theater and arts \(and the relics of those things still exist today\), Uptown in the 1960s was and still is one of the toughest neighborhoods in North Chicago. The protagonist, Karen, is a quirky loner who forced to grow up quickly as the child of a single mom who is often left in the care of her loving but sketchy 20-something brother. Karen turns to her journal to vent, but mostly to process the things she sees and hears to try to understand the complex world she lives in.

_Karen's self-portrait_

Unlike many graphic novels where the reader gets a 3rd person overhead view of all of the characters, we are seeing everything through Karen’s perspective through her diary. From the beginning, the reader notices one strong detail...all of the pages in the book look like traditional notebook paper. The blue lines cut through every page, and it makes sense. The author wants us to see what Karen sees, and nearly every school aged kid has a wide or college ruled spiral notebook hanging around. \(Not to mention they are very cheap, and much easier for a poor urban teen to access\). The reader notices that she writes in block lettering...not typical of a teenager in a diary. But Karen explains that too, so that the lettering also becomes and important visual aspect of the story.

There is a mix of art, some realistic and some fantasy. There are pages that play into the traditional comic format with panels and word balloons while some pages go completely away from that and are sometimes hard to read. These blends of style and drawing often represent how Karen is feeling, or what event she is trying to process. These blends of style allow us to see her frustration, confusion, and even happiness.

Anyone who kept a childhood or teenage journal understands how important it could be for divulging your biggest secrets, telling your most embarrassing stories, or your sometimes narrow points of view on the adult world. By looking at Karen’s world through her diary...a personal narrative not “meant” to be shared necessarily...the reader is transported back to that awkward in-between of childhood and adulthood. It constantly flip between classic comic strip and sketchpad in a way that represents the chaotic nature of Karen’s emotions and experiences. Meanwhile, the art itself is so detailed and often disturbing that it could nearly tell the story without the written narrative. This is a refreshing take on the graphic novel that is worth a read if you’re into that genre.
