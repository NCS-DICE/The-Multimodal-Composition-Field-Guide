**Video Rhetoric: EWG Program’s “Setting The Bar Low”**

**  
**

**For my video analysis, I chose “Setting the Bar Low” by Wander on behalf of the Environmental Working Group \(EWG\). The Environmental Working Group is an organization that researches and “calls out” companies who use questionable chemical compounds in their products. They also have website ranking certain beauty/body care products based on ingredients and potential toxicity. **

**How silly would it be if we admired athletes and artists for doing the bare minimum? In EWG/Wander’s opinion, that is what we are doing with manufacturers. By making “heroic” feats we know so well look ridiculous, they are asking us in a way...why don’t we hold companies to the same standards as we hold our cultural heroes? Using the Olympics, mountain climbing, and conductor/orchestra as recognizable exciting/important moments, they are able to communicate the level that they believe manufacturers should be held to. They should be the heroes of product safety! EWG’s stance is that the products we are receiving are the equivalent of a 7.5 inch high jump. By engaging these familiar cultural messages, the EWG is able to communicate how dire the issue is to a broad audience.**

**Video is an effective mode for this message because it triggers memories of the things we watched...old educational videos, sporting events, music, etc. They are also able to use a mix of different modes within the video...visual, aural, and text...to communicate their message. I think that’s why videos can have so much emotional impact, they have the ability to overtake multiple senses at once and leave a lasting impression.**

**My video: When the tablet’s away, the kids will play.**

**My son is pretty much the only person in my life that will let me film him willingly. Like many kids, he is pretty tablet/tv/game obsessed. It's been a constant struggle to kind of monitor and limit his use of devices without demonizing them. Honestly, sometimes I’m grateful he’s distracted by them when he’s forced to follow me around to work/study group, but I love watching him play. I guess that’s what I wanted to communicate in my 5 shots: how kids kind of bloom in their play, and they don’t really do that in front of a screen. They are so expressive, energetic, and creative when they actually have to use their brains.**
