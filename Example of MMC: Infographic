## Infographic as Multimodal Composition

My example of a multimodal composition is the Infographic. I think infographics are adaptable and allow an author to present rhetoric to their audience using a variety of mediums, like using an infographic singularly, or as a summary of text presented in conjunction with the infographic. There are usually two different modes used in creating an infographic, text and visuals, but the author, if they are technically proficient, can use aural or video clips as a rhetorical mode.
