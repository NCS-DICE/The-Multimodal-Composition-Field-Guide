##Introduction
<!-- This section should be an overview of what the modality of still images is and why the multimodal composer should be concerned with them. -->

When you log into social media, do you see who you love? If you were able to look through ever add that was targeted to you, every article you've read, and every post you've interacted with, what would it tell you about who you "heart"? Mine might tell me I "heart" NPR, dog videos, and memes more than any of the actual people I'm friends with on Facebook.
For my visual rhetoric piece, I wanted to focus on the theme of connection and social media. I decided to make a Valentine in honor of the upcoming holiday, and I wanted it to reflect what I engage with on a daily basis. These are partly things I choose to engage with, and partly what Facebook decides is best for me. Recently, it has been in the news that Facebook is once again changing their algorithm to encourage more "connection" between people, the ones we "love". Posts for business pages/news websites/clickbait/etc. will not be prioritized by this new algorithm and instead it will prioritize the people on your friend's list. I decided to take a look at my own Facebook feed to analyze what I am connecting with when I scroll through.
While I do often see personal posts from friends and family, I'm also barraged with posts that are not personal at all. In fact, I large share of my social media feed is advertisements, articles, videos, memes, images, etc. that are shared by pages or other individuals. Sometimes my friends/family don't even have to share them for me to see them...they just simply have to "like" them. Also, a lot of times what I see on my feed is jumbled and random. There are posts about celebrities next to news stories about war, stories of crime and violence sitting above videos of baby animals. It's overwhelming, disjointing, contradictory, and doesn't really give me a feeling of real connection to the world at all. When I look back at my activity log, most of my engagement goes toward these random posts rather than people I know.
When collecting the images for my visual, I decided to do the "ABCs" of my Facebook feed to get a variety of images. As I scrolled through, I filled in a type of "post" I saw for every single letter. Here is what I came up with:
A- Animals
B- Bikini Bodies
C- Celebrities
D- Detox Diets
E- Eating
F- Fashion
G- Global Warming
H- Health Care
I- Immigration
J- Jewelry
K- Kardashians
L- Life Hacks
M- Minimalism
N- New Year, New You!
O- Obama
P- Politics
Q- Quotes (inspirational)
R-  The Royals
S- Social Justice
T-  Television Shows
U- USA! USA!
V- Violent Crime
W- World War III
X- Xenophobia
Y- Yoga
Z- Zombie
What I learned was...my social media is definitely a smattering of randomness that does dilute a lot of the personal posts from the people I know. So when I do log in, expecting connection, I connect with this scattered information. It doesn't really seem to detour me, or anyone else I know, from logging in over and over again. The connection many of us claim to seek from social media is not really the connection many of us get. I'm not sure what kind of an impact Facebook's changes will actually have on this socially (or even how much we will notice), but perhaps we've reached a point where people need something different.
