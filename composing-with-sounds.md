#Composing with Sounds
##Introduction
<!-- This section should be an overview of what the modality of sounds is and why the multimodal composer should be concerned with them. -->
##Marisol:
Audio or sounds can be persuasive. Have you ever stopped to hear the sounds of coming home? From the moment you walk home and enter your apartment building, push the elevator button, pull out your keys to unlock the door, turn on the tv, run the dish washer and finally open up a soft drink to end the night. Sounds are all around us from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall into a deep sleep. What do these sounds say about the person, their environment, and their daily routines? How do all these sounds that we produce affect others?

I decided to focus on the sounds that I hear coming home to my studio apartment after a long day of work and school. I live alone in a studio apartment near Green Lake and I love the calm and quiet nature of the neighborhood. Other than the beautiful serene lake it’s probably one of the other main reasons people choose to live in this neighborhood. A few days ago all of the residents in my apartment building received a friendly reminder email from the property manager to kindly keep the noise level down between the hours of 10pm to 7am. I come home late after school or studying at the coffee shop so I was curious to know if I too contribute to the residential noise disturbances. I had never really quite noticed all of the sounds that I produced coming home so I decided to set out to use my audio recorder to capture all of the sounds.

I began my journey home after school one day and began recording after I parked my car. The sounds of birds chirping and cars passing by greeted me just before I entered the apartment complex. Beep, beep,…beep, were the sounds of my key card scanning the door entrance and elevator keypad. As I walk down the hallway and take out my dangling set of multiple keys to open my apartment door, the door slams behind me, I lock it and hang my purse near the door.

I walk across the wooden floor in my two inch heel boots, throw the keys on the bed, and open the refrigerator to find some apple juice in a glass container. Quenching for thirst, I open the glass bottle, gulp down the remaining juice, and place the bottle and metal cap on the counter before walking over to load the dishwasher. I turn on the faucet to rinse off the food from the dirty dishes I left in the sink to then place them into the dishwasher for cleaning. I place the dirty dishes into the dishwasher and run the appliance. I walk over to the couch to grab the remote control and turn on the tv. The loud sounds of the running water filling up the dishwasher, soap suds, and turning sounds of the cycle was intrusive to me watching tv even when I turned up the volume on the tv, so I turned it off and decided to read a book instead.

After hearing these collective sounds play back on audio, I came to realize that all of the sounds we produce simply from coming home can have an adverse affect on some people and can disturb their sleep and idea of wanting a quiet residential neighborhood. Some people are more prone to sensory sensitivity or overstimulation to sounds. I can certainly relate, I too have become more sensitive to sounds and overstimulation of sounds. The way I deal with too many sounds is to go for a run without any headphones or I meditate after doing some yoga. When those two solutions are not an option it causes me to feel irritated and annoyed by the sounds when I’m trying to fall asleep. So to be a good neighbor, please be mindful of the collective noise and sounds you produce when coming home.

Audio Rhetoric: The Walk
{insert audio file}
When I’m frustrated or anxious …I walk. When my son is cranky or is feeling wiggly…we walk. It’s a cure for whatever ails me, or it at least distracts me from what I don’t want to do. It gives me purpose, moving forward…burning calories…whatever thought keeps me going a I work through my troubles on the sidewalk.
I throw on my favorite coat, my dirty purple puffy coat that swooshes loudly while I walk. I leave the house and slam the door. Today I’m annoyed, overwhelmed. I don’t even take the dog with me this time…I’m tired of her barking and her demands. I’m tired of my son’s talking and demands. I need to be alone. I walk quickly across the parking lot and shove my headphones in. I hope I don’t run into a neighbor…I live in a friendly neighborhood, and everyone wants to stop and chat about the weather, and the grass, and the stray cat situation. My music is supposed to be soothing but it hardly works, I swoosh angrily down the sidewalk and the cold wind hurts my ears. I think about the things my boyfriend didn’t say right and about how the cat woke me up at 2am with her yowling.
My sulking temporarily comes to a halt as a neighbor walks toward me. The one with the 3 little dogs. Annoying dogs, barking dogs. Oh, except the brown one. Actually, the 2 black ones are cute too. Ok, maybe they are not very annoying. Just like with my dog, I’m won over by their small noses and big brown eyes. Their owner approaches and makes a comment, and I have to do that “polite” laugh. But then the brown dog jumps on my leg gently, and the two others approach my hand as I reach down instinctually. I laugh genuinely now. She tells me to “have a good night”. I’m still giggling. My dog also reaches out for anyone who gives her half a glance on the sidewalk. She’s not so bad.
Same with the cat. She does the yowling, but she’s 18 years old. Being old has made her very needy, and a formerly aloof kitty had become quite the cuddler in her senior years. She’s pretty sweet.
My kid is also sweet. Sometimes, he just talks so much…and argues, and barters. It’s kind of amazing the level of skill he uses to go back and forth with me. We are a long way from throwing tantrums over getting the wrong teddy bear. His brain moves constantly, and he’s so creative. And I’m fortunate enough to be the one he tells everything too…whether it’s a story about a hero named Toilet Boy, or about conflict at school. I’m glad he’s not too quiet, I guess.
And I’m not sure how I can get on my boyfriend’s case about saying the wrong thing. I constantly say the wrong thing. And maybe I needed to hear what he said. I should probably text him. Oh wow, my fingers are frozen.
It’s cold out, but at least it’s not raining. The air is fresh. My legs work. My coat is warm. I like this song. But it’s time to go inside. What was I mad about, anyway?
